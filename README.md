# This repository contains Linux Scrip file for service automation.
# If you want the program to start whenever you log in, and you are using a XDG-compliant desktop environment
# (e.g. GNOME or KDE), put a .desktop file into ~/.config/autostart. For an example of a .desktop file, see the Arch wiki.

# Alternately, if your Linux distro uses systemd, you can write an unit file
# which is a .service file.
